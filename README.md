===========

###Etiquette
- Remember to create and work in a seperate branch for each feature, bug and so on.
- Name branches after the ticket being addressed.
- **DO NOT** merge into dev unless via *pull requests*
- Pull requests must be approved by a teammate, i.e. that the change has been successful and the code is satisfactory.

###Software Engineering Practices
- Where possible, have **unit tested** code!
- Follow [Unity best practices](http://devmag.org.za/2012/07/12/50-tips-for-working-with-unity-best-practices/)

###Workflow
The workflow we will be a simplified version of the system described in the image below. We will mostly work out of **dev** until major milestones are reached.
